        <p>
          If you’ve been to any Kenyan event and there was no pilau on the menu,
          then you know they’re not doing it right. Pilau is a common swahili
          dish from Kenya and Tanzania.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is made from rice that has been cooked in spices like, cumin,
          cloves, cinnamon and cardamom while browning the onions, and it is
          this browning of onions that gives the pilau that brown color. You can
          use either beef, goat or chicken as meat options and the authentic way
          of serving it is with kachumbari, a mix of tomatoes and onions.

        <h2>Step by Step Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large pot, add some Pure Infused Canola oil and chopped onions.
            You’ll need to fry the onions until brown. Be careful not to burn
            the onions. This is the secret to making brown pilau and you want to
            take time while doing this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next we add the garlic and our whole potatoes. You’ll notice the
            brown color on the potatoes as you keep stirring and this means
            you’ve done the onions justice! Add your pilau masala here and stir.
            let everything cook for a few minutes covered but be careful not to
            let it burn, then add the precooked beef. Keep stirring.
          </li>
          <li>
            The next step is to add the saved broth and some water and washed
            rice. The decision on how much broth and water to add depends on how
            much rice you want to use. Rule of thumb is 2:1, 2 cups of water to
            1 cup of rice. This is also the secret to fluffy rice so you need to
            measure your rice. Stir everything to make sure its evenly
            distributed. Let this cook while covered on high heat until the
            water almost evaporates.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the rice looks like it’s almost done, cover with aluminum foil
            and reduce heat to low, let it simmer for 10 minutes.
          </li>
